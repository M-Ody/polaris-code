# Polaris
This repository contains the source code of **Polaris**, a student project.

All code was writted by **M-Ody**.

The game was build in **Unity 2017.2.0f3**, but it will not build as it is in this repository because the lack of assets. This is only for reference.

# Notice
Do not use this as a source of well-written code. Part of the project was made through a though deadline. However, I believe that some people can enjoy having a look at how we had gone about bringing the game to life.
