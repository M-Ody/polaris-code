# Polaris
This repository contains the source code of the **Polaris** game, which you can download for free [here](https://m-ody.itch.io/polaris).

I worked as the solo programmer in this game, with a team working on level design, modelling and texturing.

The game was built in **Unity 2017.2.0f3**, but it will not build as it is in this repository because the lack of assets. This is only for reference.

# Notes
Looking back, there's a lot of things which I would do differently today. However, I'm very proud of what this turned, despite the poor planning and lack of experience with such a big project.
